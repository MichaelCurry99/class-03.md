# Lists, Boxes, and Loop

 When it comes to using certain types of lists, it can very easy to use them! I use lists in order to create a numbered list, make rows, or to bullet point certain part of my coding. This element can be used in HTML mostly but can be used as well in the CSS coding, that is if you want to make everything look colorful and aligned! Also, I learned how to use boxes whenever I'd like to add a border to my image, or if there is a colored background for my text. I think this is great as well when using your creativity in a website you want to create.
 
 Getting into my next reading lesson, I've read about what arrays are and how they can be used in order to store a list of values, somewhat like how the HTML lists are used. 
There are many ways of how the arrays can function, though mostly they all run in a order from 0-3, depending what the values contain. The last topics cover what loops and "if...else" statements, which helps me more to understand what is true & false. So there is much more to learn than I thought in Javascript!
